What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialized a repository, a hidden folder named ".git" is created, which stores information about the repository itself and the many commits. I need to initilize a repository to tell the computer the specific directory that I want to tie my repository to.


How is the staging area different from the working directoy and the repository? What value do you thinkit offers?

Both the working directory and the repository are permanent and resembles the concept of ROM, while the staging area is temporary and resembles a RAM. Since the principle of creating commits is one commit per logical change, the staging area allows programmers to have a 'place' to work on multiple files before they finish making one logical change and save this change.
